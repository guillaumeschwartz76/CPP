# CPP01

This project is about: memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.

## Exercice 00

What is the actual point of the exercise?
You have to determine in what case it’s better to allocate a class on the stack or heap.

```shell
./Brain
```

## Exercice 01

In this exercice, we continue have to create a horde of Zombies!
Zombie*     zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );

```shell
./Moar_Brain
```

## Exercice 02

The goal of this exercise is to demystify references which can seem completely new. Although there are some little differences, this is another syntax for something you already do: address manipulation.

We have to print first:
* the address to a string
* a pointer to the string
* a reference to the string

And then their value.
```shell
./ex02
```

## Exercice 03

We have to create two classes Human and a class Weapon.

```shell
./Moar_Brain
```

## Exercice 04

Create a program that takes three parameters in the following order: a filename and
two strings, s1 and s2.
It will open the file <filename> and copies its content into a new file
<filename>.replace, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2


```shell
./sed example.txt world sun
```
```shell
cat ./example.txt.replace
```

## Exercice 05

The goal of this exercise is to use pointers to member functions. This is not a
suggestion. Harl has to complain without using a forest of if/else if/else. It doesn’t think
twice!

```shell
 ./rep
```

## Exercice 06

```shell
./harlFilter
```
```shell
./harlFilter DEBUG
```
```shell
./harlFilter INFO 
```
```shell
./harlFilter ERROR
```
```shell
./harlFilter WARNING
```
