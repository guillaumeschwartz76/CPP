# CPP00

This project is about: namespaces, classes, fonctions membres, stdio streams,
initialisation list, static, const, and other concept.

## Exercice 00

This is the beginning in cpp. you only need to capitalize a string.
if you don't send an argument to the program, it displays a sentence by default.

### Lauch the program

For example:
```shell
./megaphone " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
```

## Exercice 01

We need to design a program that behaves like a telephone directory.
The program accepts the following inputs: 

* ADD: you can add contact.
* SEARCH: displays the list of contacts and allows you to choose
 a contact to display from the maximum of 8 saved contacts.
* EXIT: The program quits and contacts are lost.s

### Lauch the program

```shell
./PhoneBook
```

## Exercice 02 BONUS

That's not all, but your manager has just given you a job to do. 

Your first mission: 
recreate a missing file. Something has gone wrong and a source file has been deleted by mistake.
Unfortunately, your colleagues don't know Git and are using USB sticks to share the code.
It would make sense to leave this place right now. Despite this, you decide to stay and take up the challenge.

You are given a few files. Compiling tests.cpp confirms that the missing file is Account.cpp.
Fortunately, the header file Account.hpp is unharmed, as is a log file.
Perhaps you could use the latter to understand how the Account (bank account) class was implemented.
You start to remake the Account.cpp file. In just a few minutes, you have typed out some genius lines of C++.
After a few failed compilations, your program passes the tests. Its output corresponds perfectly to that contained in the
log (except for the timestamp, which is bound to be different, given that the tests saved in the log were run long before you arrived).
Boy, what a talent!

Its output corresponds perfectly to that contained in the
log (except for the timestamp, which will necessarily be different as the
tests saved in the log were performed long before your arrival).

### Lauch the program

```shell
./test
```
